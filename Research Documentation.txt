Liatrio Apprenticeship Exercise Interview

Getting Git and Github repo set up
1.	Installing Git
	a.	In Powershell
		i.	git –version
		ii.	had to install git
		iii.	Git - First-Time Git Setup
	b.	Make local project folder
		i.	Run git init
		ii.	learn git commands
			git add . // this will add everything in the folder to the "staging area"
			git commit -m "Describe what we did in this commit" // this command takes a snapshot of whats in the "staging area" commits are local so nothing is on GitHub yet
			git push -u origin main // this will push the commit to GitHub, origin is the remote repository name, main is the branch name, and -u sets upstream tracking
			git push // after doing the first push with -u origin main you can use just git push to push new commits to the repo as git remembers the previous commands.  



GoLang Setup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFiXJKIF2ss
Followed tutorial to go through setting up Golang

also ran the command go mod init liatrio-api, this created a module named liatrio-api

to run go within visual studio code you use
	go run (file name)
	or
	go run . // this runs the main function in a directory.

Fiber setup
https://docs.gofiber.io/
you have to run
go get -u github.com/gofiber/fiber/v3 to install fiber
once fiber is installed within main.go you have to import "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v3" in order to use it

Fiber is a web framework for Go that is inspired by Express.js, it focuses on extreme performance and low memory footprint.  Built ontop of Fasthttp.
