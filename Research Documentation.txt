			git add . // this will add everything in the folder to the "staging area"
			git commit -m "Describe what we did in this commit" // this command takes a snapshot of whats in the "staging area" commits are local so nothing is on GitHub yet
			git push -u origin main // this will push the commit to GitHub, origin is the remote repository name, main is the branch name, and -u sets upstream tracking
			git push // after doing the first push with -u origin main you can use just git push to push new commits to the repo as git remembers the previous commands.
