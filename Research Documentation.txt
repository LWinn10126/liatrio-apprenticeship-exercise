Liatrio Apprenticeship Exercise Interview

Getting Git and Github repo set up
1.	Installing Git
	a.	In Powershell
		i.	git –version
		ii.	had to install git
		iii.	Git - First-Time Git Setup
	b.	Make local project folder
		i.	Run git init
		ii.	learn git commands
			git add . // this will add everything in the folder to the "staging area"
			git commit -m "Describe what we did in this commit" // this command takes a snapshot of whats in the "staging area" commits are local so nothing is on GitHub yet
			git push -u origin main // this will push the commit to GitHub, origin is the remote repository name, main is the branch name, and -u sets upstream tracking
			git push // after doing the first push with -u origin main you can use just git push to push new commits to the repo as git remembers the previous commands.  



GoLang Setup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFiXJKIF2ss
Followed tutorial to go through setting up Golang

also ran the command go mod init liatrio-api, this created a module named liatrio-api

to run go within visual studio code you use
	go run (file name)
	or
	go run . // this runs the main function in a directory.

Fiber setup
https://docs.gofiber.io/
you have to run
go get -u github.com/gofiber/fiber/v3 to install fiber
once fiber is installed within main.go you have to import "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v3" in order to use it

Fiber is a web framework for Go that is inspired by Express.js, it focuses on extreme performance and low memory footprint.  Built ontop of Fasthttp.

Helpful tutorial: https://dev.to/percoguru/getting-started-with-apis-in-golang-feat-fiber-and-gorm-2n34
		https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-go/json-in-go/

		https://docs.gofiber.io/
Need to learn JSON and how it applies to Go and Fiber



Dockerfile
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/multi-stage-builds/
Commands to know
docker build -t liatrio-api .  // this will build the liatrio-api container
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 liatrio-api  //this will run the docker container (--rm will delete when closed, don't always need it unless you don't want extra footprint) on port 8080

our docker file is a multi layer file.  It uses one layer to build the container and the other to run it
FROM golang... this line pulls official Go image from Docker Hub
AS builder simply names the stage builder

WORKDIR /app sets the working directory into the container  same as cd /app

COPY go.mod go.sum ./ will copy these.  Only want these so we are faster for builds
RUN go mod download  Downlaods all dependencies listed in go.mod

COPY . .  this copies everything from project directory into /app. (main.go and everthing else)

RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o server . 
	CGO_ENABLED=0 disables C library usage
	GOOS=linux will compile this for linux (Docker containers run linux)
	GOARCH=amd64 compile for 64 bit architecture
	go build -o server .  build app with binary named server

FROM scratch this gets rid of any extra fluff so we are very fast, it makes an empty container image
COPY --from=builder /app/server /server
	This goes to builder stage, copys the file /app/server and puts it in /server
	so now our final image contains only /server

EXPOSE 8080
	this just says we expect to server traffic on port 8080

CMD ["/server"]
	this is similar to ./server and it just runs the binary
